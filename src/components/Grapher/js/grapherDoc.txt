saveGraph(id, callback): save the current graph

properties:
	- allowCreate: if false, it's not possible to add object on grapher
	- allowDelete: if false, it's not possible to delete object on grapher
	- allowMove: if false, it's not possible to move object on grapher
	- allowMultiSelection: if false, it's not possible to select more than one object on grapher




Grapher
-------

constructor(common, width, height)

redisplay(computeLinks, notRedisplayTotal): redisplay content of the grapher

doZoom(factor): zoom on grapher

doZoomTotal(): fit content of the grapher in the grapher window

doPan(dx, dy): move grapher

getSelectedObjectIds(): get the id list of the selected objects

setSelectObjectCallback(callback): set the callback on selection done

setDbClickOnObjectCallback(callback): set the callback for the double clic event

isUpdated(): return true if the grapher has been updated and need to be saved

setModeAddNode(id, type, ctype, callback): activate addNode mode on the grapher

setModeAddText(id callback): activate addText mode on the grapher

setModeAddLink(id, callback): activate addLink mode on the grapher

keyboard shortcuts


pgUp-pgDn: zoom
t: total zoom
g: grid toggle
Delete: delete object
u or ctrl-z: undo 
r or ctrl-y: redo
t: zoom total
l: add link (link between selected node and clicked node)
n: add node
b: add text box

arrows: pan
on link selected:
	- arrow up/down: change the link shape
	- arrow left/right: for type 0 and 1: keep the same shape, but change the middle bar position
on objects selected:
    - arrows: move objects selection for one grid step in the arrow direction
shift-right: reorganize all nodes horizontally on the right
shift-bottom: reorganize all nodes vertically on bottom

Specific for this grapher exemple:
q: display 'monitoring' mode
w: center selected nodes one by one at each 'w' press
v: select all nodes having "_SIT_" in their text using setSelectedNodeByFunction(matchFunction) function.
1: display 'bigGraph' graph
2: display 'allNodes' graph 


mouse behavior

click on object: select an unique object (the only way to select an arrow)
click out of an object: unselect all objects
ctrl-click on object: add or remove obj from selected objects list
drag on objet: move it
drag on node text: move it arround the node
simple drag: pan 
double-clic + drag: select objet by window
shift-clic + drag: select objet by window too
ctrl-clic + drag out of an object: draw an area any form to select the objects which are in there
mouse-wheel: zoom-in, zoom-out with zoom center at mouse position, if link is selected: change the link type
